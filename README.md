# XOR Puzzle

XOR Puzzle is a simple puzzle game for nerds.
It was made for Global Game Jam 2026.
The goal is to guess the key for an XOR Cipher, decoding the original text.

## Game Modes

There are four main game modes.
The headers link to where you can play each game mode.

## [Easy Mode](https://xorpuzzle.pages.dev/?difficulty=easy)

Easy mode is the simplest and arguably best mode to play.
The key will be one byte (two hex digits).

## [Regular Mode](https://xorpuzzle.pages.dev/)

Regular mode is quite a bit harder than easy mode.
Regular mode bumps up the number of bytes to four.

## [Hard Mode](https://xorpuzzle.pages.dev/?difficulty=hard)

Hard mode is even harder.
The key can be anywhere from five to eight bytes.
Color coding of bytes is disabled.

## [Cypher's Mode](https://xorpuzzle.pages.dev/?difficulty=cypher)

Cypher's mode is the hardest game mode.
It plays the same as Hard Mode, except the text readout is turned off.
Only the hexadecimal codes will be displayed.

## [Lexicon Mode](https://xorpuzzle.pages.dev/?difficulty=lexicon)

Lexicon mode plays differently from the other modes.
Instead of a randomly generated byte key, the key will be some random word.
